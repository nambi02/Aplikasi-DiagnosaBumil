# DiagnosaBumil - Diagnosis Application for Pregnant Women

This is a Java-based desktop application for diagnosing diseases caused by malnutrition in pregnant women using the **Forward Chaining** method. This was my final project for my undergraduate studies.

## Features
- Disease diagnosis based on user input symptoms
- Rule-based system using forward chaining
- Patient data and diagnosis result storage
- User login system
- Built with Java and MySQL

## How to Run
There are two ways to run this application:

### 1. Using the shortcut
Simply double-click the `DiagnosaBumil.jar - Shortcut` file in the root folder.
