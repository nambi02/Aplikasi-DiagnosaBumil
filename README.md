# DiagnosaBumil - Diagnosis Application for Pregnant Women

This is a Java-based desktop application for diagnosing diseases caused by malnutrition in pregnant women using the **Forward Chaining** method. This was my final project for my undergraduate studies.

## Features
- Disease diagnosis based on user input symptoms
- Rule-based system using forward chaining
- Patient data and diagnosis result storage
- User login system
- Built with Java and MySQL

## How to Run

Before running the application, import the database:

1. Open [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Import the file `bumil.sql` located in the project folder.

Then, run the application using one of the two options below:

### 1. Using the shortcut

Double-click the `DiagnosaBumil.jar - Shortcut` file in the root folder.

### 2. Running manually

Go to the `src` folder and run the `DiagnosaBumil.jar` file.

> Note:  
> The login credentials can be found in `username and password.txt`.
